# Softonic Software Engineer Javascript access test

## Exercise

Implement a Web application to manage favorite series and actors.

Users should be able to search a query filtered by type (series or actors). Each result can be saved as a favorite in the list below. Multiple favorites can be selected and removed from the list. When users reload the page, their list of favorites should be preserved.

### API

The search results can be obtained from the following API:

* Endpoint for series: http://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows
* Endpoint for actors: http://api.tvmaze.com/search/people
* Query string parameters:

| Parameter | Required | Valid Options | Description                                      |
| --------- | -------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| q         | Yes      | {string}      | Serie title or actor/actress name to search for. |

* Examples:
  - Get the series that contain "house cards": [http://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=house%20cards](http://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=house%20cards)
  - Get actors that contain "Jennifer Lawrence": [http://api.tvmaze.com/search/people?q=jennifer%20lawrence](http://api.tvmaze.com/search/people?q=jennifer%20lawrence)
